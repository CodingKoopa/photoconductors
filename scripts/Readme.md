# Scripts
This directory contains scripts I wrote to automate parts of this project:
- [exportcsv.py](exportcsv.py): Exports a set of CSVs to an Excel workbook. See `exportcsv.py -h` for subcommands.
- [setupoverlay.tpcs](setupoverlay.tpcs): Sets up an overlay in Tonyplot, for comparing hole concentrations across the silicon bar.
- [fixfilenames.sh](fixfilenames.sh): Strips unneeded suffixes from the CSV files.

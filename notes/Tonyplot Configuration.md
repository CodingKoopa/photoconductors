# Tonyplot Configuration

This document details some of how I configured Tonyplot for my graphs.

## General
- For graphs which appear on the final poster, I like to edit them in GIMP for transparency.
- Right click on the graph > "Annotation..." and put in a spce for the main title and sub title to hide them.

## Program Configuration

### Document

#### Drawing Options
- For wide images:
  - Export resolution 1347x300.
  - Plot margins left 12%, top 0%, right 0%, bottom 20%. For this export resolution, this should allow enough space for the axis labels to show properly.
- For narrow images, for side by side images:
  - Export resolution 674x400.
  - Plot margins left 17%, top 0%, right 0%, bottom 15%. See above for more info.

#### Sequence Marks
- I like to choose "Circle" for the first mark to make the output plots more closely resemble something you would get from Excel.

#### Key Options
- For the graphs I used on my poster, the "Graphs" panel wasn't really needed, so I turned it off.
- I moved the "Levels" panel to the left, as that is where the legend is (by default), in Excel graphs.
  - For the busier graphs this was turned off.

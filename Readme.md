# Photoconductor Research

This repository has the code, graphs, and notes I produced for my project under the [BNL High School Research Program](https://www.bnl.gov/education/programs/program.php?q=219). This project centers around using photoconductors in silicon sensors to detect incoming particles. For more info, see:
- [The poster presentation for this project](present/Poster.pdf).
- [The slideshow presentation for this project](present/Slideshow.pdf).
- [My experimental notes](notes/Experiments.pdf).
- [My research notes.](notes/Research.pdf)

Here is how this repo is laid out:
- [data](data): Experimental data collected using Silvaco TCAD.
- [decks](decks): Silvaco Deckbuild code for using Silvaco Athena and Atlas to run simulations.
- [present](present): Renders for presentations.
- [scripts](scripts): Scripts developed for automating parts ot his project.

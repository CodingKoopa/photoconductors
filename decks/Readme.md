# Decks
This directory contains decks made for use with Silvaco's Deckbuild program:
- [Main.in](Main.in): The main deck I use. This features loops for testing variables in batch, automatic file naming, and support for simulating either a Photoconductor or Diode.
- [PhotoconductorSimple.in](PhotoconductorSimple.in): A simple deck that just simulates a photoconductor.
- [DiodeSimple.in](DiodeSimple.in): A simple deck that just simulates a diode.
